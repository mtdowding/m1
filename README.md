# MID1

Midterm 1 Project

The goal of the programming project is to implement two algorithms that calculate π, and compare their performance.

A program was written with a function that calculates π by summing the Leibniz series while the second part of the program will use the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe series to calculate π. The program will loop over the value of the parameter n, starting from n = 1, and doubling it at every iteration. At each iteration print the number of terms in the series, the result produced by your function, and the absolute error of the result. The iterations stop when there are enough terms in the series, to produce the absolute error less than tol = 10−6
